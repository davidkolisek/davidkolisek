## Quick start

To run the API or Web, please go to the package directory and run `yarn start`.

It may be necessary to deploy the dev stage at first to provision all the necessary services.
If anything depends on environment variable generated by AWS, you may need to deploy the stage with `--ignoreMissingParameters` flag first to skip any "missing env variable" or "missing stack" error.

Also, we highly recommend to periodically run `yarn checkup` to make sure that code is in the top shape.

## Netlify deploy

1. Run `yarn build` in `packages/web` directory. He will prepares to you a folder called `build`
2. `netlify deploy` for testing. `netlify deploy --prod` for deploy to production. !(Our public directory is `build`)!
